# Beautiful-HTML
~ Beautiful HTML is CSS and JavaScript code that you can just add to any web project to make it instaneously better! Add the rawgithubusercontent code links to your `<script>` and `<style>` tags in your HTML file to begin!

~ The styles will make your website look better, and there are scripts for other things!

# The Good It Does

~ Too lazy to create your own styles and scripts? Use our styles & scripts.

~ You don't really need documentation because there are comments in the scriptsheet and stylesheet that explain the code
